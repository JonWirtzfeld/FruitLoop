# FruitLoop
### Jon Wirtzfeld

## Description 
FruitLoop is a simple program that defines a base class `Fruit` and several sub-classes (`Banana`, `Tangerine`, `Pear`). Once instantiated, each fruit identifies itself to the user. 

## Getting Started
To compile FruitLoop on Ubuntu, run the following command:

`g++ -o bin/FruitLoop main.cpp`

and run with:

`./bin/FruitLoop`
